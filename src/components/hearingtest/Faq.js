                        <p>A hearing screening is a simple evaluation of the sensitivity of a person's hearing. It checks how well you hear different frequencies.</p>
                        <p>A common type of hearing screening is the pure-tone test, which tests your hearing across different pitches. You may have taken a similar test at your physicianâ€™s office where you listened to a range of beeps played at different levels.</p>
                        <p>Sound Sustainability offers an online pure-tone test that is free and easy to use. The screening only takes a few minutes and results are delivered right away.</p>

Some of these tones can be difficult to hear, especially being in a noisy environment. It may cause you to not be able to hear tones that you would normally hear, and therefore, skew your results. </p>

                        <p>This step in the calibration of your hearing screening is intended to standardize how you hear the tones we present to you.

                        <p>This is an essential step for the calibration of your hearing screening. Adjusting your volume to 50% standardizes how you hear the tones during the screening, and will ensure that you are hearing the correct frequencies at the correct volumes. It is a measure taken to ensure that you are getting a more accurate result.</p>

                        <p>Note that your results are not a medical diagnosis of your hearing levels, but they can provide information about your hearing levels that could encourage you to schedule an appointment with an audiologist. </p>
                        <p>You will be provided with a statement informing you of your result as well as an audiogram, which this statement was determined from.</p>
                        <p>Your results will be displayed as an <span className="font-weight-bold">audiogram</span>. An audiogram is a graph that shows the softest sounds a person can hear at different frequencies, for each ear. Namely, it presents the frequencies and decibels that you were able to hear. Frequency, or pitch, is in Hz, and decibel (dB) is a relative volume measurement. Where these values fall on the audiogram will indicate the degree of hearing loss that you could have. Marks closer to the bottom of this graph indicate that softer tones were heard (lower dB). The different variations of results you could receive are normal, mild, moderate, moderately-severe, severe, or severely profound.</p>
